Timelapse Webcam for Raspberry PI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Uses the python rpi-camera library to take timelapse pictures via the RPI camera

These are HTTP posted to a .net website, which squirts them into a SQL Database

The same .net website can then be used to query pictures/sequences from SQL data

Uses bumpkit for the GIF creation
